The (Siegel) Eisenstein series in degree 2
 of weight \(k\geq4\) is defined by the formula
\[
 \psi_k(Z)=\sum_{(C,D)}\det(CZ+D)^{-k},
\]
where the summation extends over all inequivalent bottom rows \((C,D)\) of elements of 
the <a class="knowl-title" knowl="mf.siegel.group.symplectic">integral symplectic group</a>
\({\rm Sp}(4,\mathbb{Z})\)
 with respect to left multiplication by elements of \({\rm SL}(2,\mathbb{Z})\).

Siegel Eisenstein series are also defined in higher degree,
and for some subgroups of the full integral symplectic group as well.
