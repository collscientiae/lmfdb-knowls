A Duke-Imamoglu-Ikeda lift is a lift from
<a class="knowl-title" knowl="mf.elliptic">elliptic modular forms</a>
 to 
<a class="knowl-title" knowl="mf.siegel">Siegel modular forms</a>
of even degree
with respect to the 
<a class="knowl-title" knowl="mf.siegel.group.symplectic">
full modular group</a>.
An elliptic cusp eigenform of weight $k$ may be lifted to
a cusp eigenform of even degree $n$ of even weight $(k+n)/2$.
