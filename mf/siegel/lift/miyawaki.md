Miyawaki conjectured two types lifts.

<p><b>Miyawaki Lift Type I</b>
Given two elliptic cusp eigenforms, $f$ of weight $k$ and $g$ of weight $2k-4$,
there exists an eigenform in degree $3$
whose $L$-function is a product of $L$-functions related to those of $f$ and $g$.
</p>

<p><b>Miyawaki Lift Type II</b>
Given two elliptic cusp eigenforms, $f$ of weight $k-2$ and $g$ of weight $2k-2$,
there exists an eigenform in degree $3$
whose $L$-function is a product of $L$-functions related to those of $f$ and $g$.
</p>

The first type is proven in a more general setting by Ikeda,
by using a Duke-Imamoglu-Ikeda lift of $g$.
Specifically, Ikeda proved the following.

<p><b>Theorem (Ikeda-Miyawaki Lift Type I)</b>
Let $k$, $n+r$, and $m=(n+r+k)/2$ be all even integers with $r\le n$.
Given: an elliptic cusp eigenforms, $f$ of weight $k$ and 
a cusp eigenform $g$ in degree $r$ of weight $2m$,
there exists an eigenform in degree $n$ of weight $m$
such that if nonzero it has an
$L$-function that is a product of $L$-functions related to those of $f$ and $g$.
</p>

In degree 3, Miyawaki lift are lifts from two 
<a class="knowl-title" knowl="mf.elliptic">elliptic modular forms</a>
 to a
<a class="knowl-title" knowl="mf.siegel">Siegel modular form</a>
of degree $3$.

Miyawaki lifts in higher degree are possible.
