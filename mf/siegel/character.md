Given a group $\Gamma\subset \Sp(2g,\R)$,

a character $\psi$ is a multiplicative homomorphism
$\psi:\Gamma\to\C$.

A function $f$ is a Siegel modular form 
of weight $k$
with respect to subgroup $\Gamma$
and character $\psi$ 
is such that
for all $\gamma=\left(\begin{smallmatrix}A&B\\C&D
\end{smallmatrix}\right) \in\Gamma$, we have
$$f((A\Omega+B)(C\Omega+D))
=\psi(\gamma) \det(C\Omega+D)^k f(\Omega),$$
and we write
$M_k(\Gamma,\psi)$ for the space of such forms.
