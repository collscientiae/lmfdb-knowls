Siegel Modular Forms
====================

## Home Page

- Provide data for and make links to the L-function section.

- Improve the presentation of many and big Fourier coefficients: the user should be able to ask for a range, reduction modulo arbitrary ideals of the number field generated by the coefficients should be possible (currently one can only reduce modula rational primes).

## Database

- Compute generators and examples for the rings $\Gamma_0(2)$, $\Gamma_0(3)$, $\Gamma_0(4)$
  (possibly with characters).

- Implement the data of Ibukiyama and Hayashida on half integral weight and vector valued modular forms. 

- Let mongodb or sqlite keep the date.

- Normalise the Fourier coefficients so that they are integral and primitive.
