We have the Siegel phi map
from degree $g$ down to degree $g-1$:
$$\Phi: M_k^{(g)}\to M_k^{(g-1)}$$
defined by
$$\Phi(f)(\Omega) = \lim_{t\to\infty}
f(\left(
\begin{smallmatrix}\Omega&0\\0&it\end{smallmatrix}\right)).$$

We say $f$ is a cusp form if for all
$\gamma\in Sp(2g,{\Bbb Q})$,
we have
$$\Phi(f|\gamma)=0$$
where $|$ is the slash operator.
