The symplectic group  $\Sp(2g, {\Bbb R})$, for degree $g$,
 is defined as 
$$\Sp(2g, {\Bbb R})
=\left\{
M=\left(\begin{matrix}A&B\\C&D\end{matrix}\right)
:
\,^tMJM=J\right\},$$
where $J=\left(\begin{matrix}0&I\\-I&0\end{matrix}\right)$ and $^tM$ denotes the transpose of $M$.

The integral symplectic group, also known as the full modular group,
is $\Sp(2g, \Z) = \Sp(2g, \R)\cap \GL(2g, \Z)$.
