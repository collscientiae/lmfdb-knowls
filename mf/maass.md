The term **Maass form** is used for automorphic forms on \( GL_{n} \) (for some positive integer n), which are not holomorphic. 
Instead of satisfying the  Cauchy-Riemann equations (as holomorphic functions do), these functions are eigenfunctions of the Casimir element in the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of \( GL_{n} \).
