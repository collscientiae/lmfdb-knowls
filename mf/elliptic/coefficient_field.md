The space of <a knowl="lmfdb/mf.elliptic.cusp_form">cusp forms</a> $S_k^\mathrm{new}(N,\chi)$ has a basis of modular forms with algebraic <a knowl="lmfdb/mf.elliptic.fourier_coefficient">Fourier coefficients</a> that are simultaneous eigenforms for all <a knowl="lmfdb/mf.elliptic.hecke_operator">Hecke operators</a>.

The coefficients of a <a knowl="lmfdb/mf.elliptic.newform">mf.elliptic.newform</a> are in fact algebraic integers.

We use the following convention when displaying the algebraic Fourier expansions of elliptic modular forms in $S_k(N,\chi$).
If $m$ is the smallest positive integer, such that the values of the character $\chi$ are contained in the cyclotomic field $\Q(\zeta_m)$, we embed $\Q(\zeta_m)$ into $\C$, such that $\zeta_m$ is identified with $\mathrm{exp}(\tfrac{2 \pi i}{ m })$.
Then we let $a$ be a primitive element of the relative extension
of the field of definition $K_f$ of the coefficients of the respective newform $f$
over $\Q(\zeta_m)$ and write the coefficients of $f$ in terms of a power basis $1, a, a^2, \ldots$ of $K_f/\Q(\zeta_m)$ and $1, \zeta_m, \zeta_m^2, \ldots$ of $\Q(\zeta_m)$.
