Elliptic modular forms
======================

Navigation pages
----------------
- Add a paragraph above each browsable table (Gamma_0(N) and
Gamma_1(N)) describing how much data is currently available

Home pages
----------
- Give an option to show the dimensions of the whole space (including oldforms)
- Make it possible to show a basis for the whole space, not "only" representatives for the Galois orbits
- Show sage/magma(?) commands
- produce zoom-able images of fundamental domains

Available data
--------------
- Rewrite the whole backend for getting data for modular forms (spaces)
- Use (mostly) William's recently computed data
- Include Eisenstein series
- Add links to the lifts (e.g., Saito-Kurokawa) of classical MFs
- Add more data to the homepages of spaces of newforms (e.g., Hecke
polynomial (factored?))
- Add Satake parameters at "bad" primes
