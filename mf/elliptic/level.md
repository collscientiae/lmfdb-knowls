A **level** of an elliptic modular form $f$ is an integer $N$ such that $f$ transforms in a modular fashion under the action of a subgroup $\Gamma$ of $\mbox{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ that contains the principal congruence subgroup $\Gamma(N)$.

The word **level** is sometimes used to designate the minimal such integer.
