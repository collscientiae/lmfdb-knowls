The space of cusp forms $S_k(N, \chi)$ has a basis of forms with algebraic Fourier coefficients.

The Galois group $\Gal(\bar\Q/\Q)$ acts on the modular forms by the action on the coefficients in the $q$-expansion of a modular form.

If $f \in S_k^{\mathrm{new}}(N, \chi)$ is a newform, then we call the intersection 
of $\Gal(\bar\Q/\Q) \cdot f$ with $S_k^{\mathrm{new}}(N, \chi)$ its associated Galois orbit. It is equal to the orbit of $f$ under the largest subgroup of $\Gal(\bar\Q/\Q)$ that acts trivially on $\chi$.

We can thus decompose $S_k^{\mathrm{new}}(N, \chi)$ into such Galois orbits.
