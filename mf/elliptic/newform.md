Let \(S_k(N,\chi)\) be the vector space of holomorphic cusp forms of weight \(k\) on the subgroup \(\Gamma_1(N)\) with character $\chi$ under $\Gamma_0(N)$. 

The subspace spanned by all cusp forms of the form \(f(d\tau)\) where \(f \in S_k(M,\psi)\), with \(N=Md\) for some \( d>1 \) and $\psi$ is a Dirichlet character modulo $M$, which induces $\chi$, is called the **oldspace**. 

The orthogonal complement of the oldspace is called the **newspace**.

A **newform** is a function \(f\) in the newspace, which is additionally an eigenfunction of all Hecke operators and all Atkin-Lehner involutions, normalized, such that the first Fourier coefficient is equal to $1$.
