The **character** of an <a knowl="lmfdb/mf.elliptic">elliptic modular form</a> $f$ is the <a knowl="lmfdb/character.dirichlet">Dirichlet character</a> $\chi$ that appears in its transformation under the action of the defining group $\Gamma.$ Namely, 
\[f(\gamma z) = \chi(d)(cz+d)^k f(z)
\] 
for any $z\in\mathcal{H}$ and $\gamma = \begin{pmatrix} * & * \\ c & d  \end{pmatrix}\in\Gamma$, where $\Gamma$ is a subgroup of $\rm{SL}_2(\mathbb{Z})$ containing the principal congruence subgroup $\Gamma(N)$. The integer $k$ is the <a knowl="lmfdb/mf.elliptic.weight">weight</a> of $f$ and $N$ is its <a knowl="lmfdb/mf.elliptic.level">level</a>.
