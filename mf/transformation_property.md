A <a knowl="lmfdb/mf">modular form</a> $f$ satisfies a transformation property for a group $\Gamma$, which closely relates the value of $f$ at a given point in its domain with the value of $f$ at the point moved under a group action of $\Gamma$ on the domain.

For example in the classical case, a modular form $f:\mathcal{H}\rightarrow\C$ satisfies the transformation
\[
f(\gamma z) = f\left(\frac{az+b}{cz+d}\right)= (cz+d)^kf(z),
\]  
for all $z\in\mathcal{H}$ and $\gamma=\left(\begin{array}{ll}a&b\\c&d\end{array}\right)\in\SL_2(\Z)$.
