Hilbert modular forms
==================
Approximately 240000 forms are available over totally real fields of degree up to 6.

Navigation pages
------------------
- Do spaces of Hilbert modular forms need spaces?  After classical modular forms have a well-designed idea for navigation, copy it.
- Provide detailed information about the scope (and completeness) of the data.
 
Home pages
------------------
- Compute the Asai L-function.
- Make base field look like ECNF (as a knowl). 
- Test Riemann hypothesis button on coefficients. (This should be available as a general improvement on all L-function home pages.)
- Compute remaining Atkin-Lehner involutions (5% of spaces missing, all with large level).
- Compute Eisenstein ideal (torsion).
- Simplify presentation of Hecke field (adjoin all elements to get an order, or mimic classical modular forms by working with the dual).
- Sort by conductor
- Add next / previous buttons (like on the Dirichlet character pages).
- Indicate which forms are lifts/base change from GL(2)/Q, and provide a friend link for forms that are base change.

Available Data
------------------
- Compute large sets of coefficients for the forms of smallest conductor.

Technical Issues
------------------
- The "?label=" works but breaks other links when followed after.
 
Possible new subcategories
------------------
- Higher weight, odd weight, half-integral weight, and characters.
- Maass forms.
