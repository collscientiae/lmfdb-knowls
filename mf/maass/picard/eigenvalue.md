title: Spectral parameter of Maass forms on PSL(2,Z[i])
authors:
    then

Each Maass form is associated to an eigenvalue via the eigenvalue equation $(\Delta+\lambda)f(z)=0$.  It is convenient to introduce the **spectral parameter** $r$ which is also called the eigenvalue.  Only if one speaks about the **true eigenvalue** one refers to $\lambda$, since by convention **eigenvalue** refers to $r$.  In hyperbolic 3-space, the eigenvalue is connected to the true eigenvalue via $\lambda=r^2+1$.
