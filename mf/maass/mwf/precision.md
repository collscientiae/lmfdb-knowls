title: The precision of an eigenvalue
authors:

The precision given in this column is a heuristic estimate of the difference between the numerically computed spectral parameter given in the column "eigenvalue" and the spectral parameter of the closest "true" eigenvalue.

There are several heuristic tests involved. For example one can check if Hecke relations are satisfied. 
The skeptical reader is encouraged to take a look at the Fourier coefficients (in the cases where they are given) and check relations of the form 
\( c(m) c(n) = c(mn) \) for co-prime $m$ and $n$ by her/him self. 
**Caveat**: when the multiplicity is greater than two (especially in the cases of oldforms) there are some cases where the given Fourier coefficients does not correspond to a Hecke eigenbasis.
