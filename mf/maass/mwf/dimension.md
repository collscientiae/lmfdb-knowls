By the multiplicity of a Laplace eigenvalue we mean the dimension of the space \( \mathcal{M}(\Gamma,\chi,\lambda) \) of Maass waveforms on the group \( \Gamma \) and character \( \chi \) and the same Laplace eigenvalue \(\lambda\).

It is generally believed that these eigenspaces are one-dimensional unless there is a symmetry present. There are essentially three known cases where the dimension is greater than one: 
1. If the eigenvalue corresponds to an oldspace in the sense of Atkin and Lehner.
2. If the character \(\chi \) has quadratic characters as factors.
3. If \(\Gamma=\Gamma_{0}(N)\) with $9|N$ 
The above three cases are proven and the generalization of 3. to other square factors greater than 9 is conjectured. 

In this table, the dimension is found experimentally by looking for  the dimension of the kernel of a linear system of equations. Due to the nature of these numerical computations the listed multiplicity should be considered as a conjectural lower bound.
