title: The level of a Maass form
authors:

A Maass form \( f \) is said to have level $N$ if \( f\) is invariant under the principal congruence subgroup \( \Gamma(N) \).
In this table a level $N$ means that we found the corresponding eigenvalue in the spectrum of \( \Gamma_{0}(N) \) with trivial or non-trivial character.
