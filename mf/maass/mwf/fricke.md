title: Fricke eigenvalue

The Fricke involution is the involution of $\Gamma_{0}(N)$ given by  $z\mapsto \frac{-1}{Nz}$.
This map also acts as an involution on the space of Maass waveforms with trivial character and in this column we list the eigenvalue of the associated Maass form. 

**Note**: The Fricke invlution also acts on some spaces with non-trivial character but in these cases it does not commute with all Hecke operators and in this table we usually choose a Hecke eigenbasis rather than a Fricke eigenbasis.
