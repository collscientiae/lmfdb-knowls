The modular group and its congruence subgroups has an outer automorphism of order two, which is given by the reflection in the imaginary axis: \( z=x+iy \mapsto -\bar{z}=-x+iy \).
This map belongs to $\mathrm{PGL}(2,\mathbb{Z})$ and can be represented by the matrix 
$\left( \matrix{ -1 & 0 \\ 0 & 1 } \right)$.  

A Maass form $f$ is said to be **even** if $f(-\bar{z})=f(z)$ and **odd** if $f(-\bar{z})=-f(z)$.
