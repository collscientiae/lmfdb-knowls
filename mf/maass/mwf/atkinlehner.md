The Atkin-Lehner involutions are involutions of $\Gamma_{0}(N)$ which are of the form 
$W_Q=\left( \matrix{ Qx & y \\ Nz & Qw} \right) $ where $Q|N$ and $x,y,z,w$ are integers satisfying $ Q^2xw-Nzy=Q$. 

If a cusp of $\Gamma_0(N)$ is of the form $Q/N$ and $\mathrm{gcd}(Q,N/Q)=1$ we can choose an Aktkin-Lehner map $W_Q$ as a cusp-normalizing map for this cusp, that is
$W_Q(\infty)=N/Q$. If $h$ denotes the width of the cusp $\frac{Q}{N}$ then $W_Q T^h W_{Q}^{-1}$ is a generator of the stabilizer of $\frac{Q}{N}$ in $\Gamma_{0}(N)$.

In this column we give a list of integers corresponding to the eigenvalue of the Atkin-Lehner operators corresponding to the cusps of the given $\Gamma_0(N)$. 
The first entry is always $1$ and corresponds to the cusp at infinity. The second entry corresponds to the cusp at $0$ and is the same as the Fricke eigenvalue.
The remaining entries of the list are zero either  if there are no Atkin-Lehner involutions of this cusp, **or** if the particular Maass form we computed is not an eigenfunction.
