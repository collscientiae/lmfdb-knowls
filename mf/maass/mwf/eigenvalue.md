For Maass forms on GL(2), it is common to refer to the spectral parameter, $R$, as the "eigenvalue", where the actual Laplace eigenvalue is $\lambda=\frac{1}{4}+R^2$.

The spectral parameter is computed numerically and it is not proven to be accurate. In practice it should however be accurate to the precision shown in the column "precision".
