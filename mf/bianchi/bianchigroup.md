Let $K$ be an imaginary quadratic field and $\mathcal{O}$ be its ring of integers. Then the group 
$$\textrm{PSL}_2(\mathcal{O})$$ 
is called the **Bianchi group associated to** $K$.

Bianchi groups are discrete subgroups of $\textrm{PSL}_2(\mathbb{C})$. The latter can be 
identified with the group of orientation-preserving isometries of the 
<a knowl="lmfdb/mf.bianchi.hyperbolic3space">hyperbolic 3-space</a> $\mathcal{H}_3$ and as a result, every Bianchi group $G$ act properly discontinuously on $\mathcal{H}_3$. The quotient space $G \backslash \mathcal{H}_3$ is a non-compact hyperbolic 3-fold with finite volume.
