Artin representations
=====================

Navigation pages
----------------

The search page will be expanded to include searches based on information depending on the Artin field (for instance the Galois group). 
       
Home pages
----------

 - A link from degree 1 Artin representations to the corresponding Dirichlet character needs to be added (and similarly for L-functions)
 - Non integral root numbers need to be calculated (for 1-dimensional, based on Gauss sums, for higher dimensional reps, based on analytic approximation)

 - A link from degree 2 Artin representations to the corresponding modular form will be added.

Available data
--------------
Very limited data is available right now (37000 representations). We will soon add more data, coming from computations of Tim Dokchitser.
