The **Artin field** is a <a knowl="lmfdb/nf">number field</a> associated to an <a knowl="lmfdb/artin">Artin representation</a>
$\rho:\mathrm{Gal}(\overline{\Q}/\Q)\to\GL(V)$
by being the smallest Galois extension $K/\mathbb{Q}$ such that $\rho$ factors through
$\mathrm{Gal}(K/\Q)$.

It is presented as the splitting field of a defining polynomial.
