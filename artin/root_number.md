The **root number** of an <a knowl="lmfdb/artin">Artin representation</a> $\rho$,
also called the **sign**, is the constant $W(\rho)$ appearing in the
<a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.functional_equation">functional equation</a>
of the associated <a knowl="lmfdb/artin.lfunction">L-function</a>, i.e. the complex number $W(\rho)$ of absolute value $1$ such that $\Lambda(s,\rho)=W(\rho)\Lambda(1-s,\overline{\rho})$.  It can be expressed as a product of local root numbers.
