If $G$ is a finite group and $\chi$, the character of a complex representation, then the **Frobenius-Schur indicator** is given by
\[ \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g\in G} \chi(g^2).\]
It is $0$, $1$, or $-1$ depending on whether the representation is of complex type, real type, or quaternionic type respectively.
