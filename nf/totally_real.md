A <a knowl="lmfdb/nf">global number field</a> $K$ is always of the form $K=\Q(\alpha)$ where $\alpha$ has monic irreducible polynomial $f(x)\in\Q[x]$.  The field is **totally real** if all of the roots of $f(x)$ in $\C$ lie in the real numbers $\R$.  

Equivalently, $K$ is totally real if all homomorphisms $K\to\C$ have image contained in $\R$.
