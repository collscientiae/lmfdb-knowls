The **ring of integers** of a <a knowl="lmfdb/nf">number field</a> $K$ is the integral closure of $\mathbb Z$ in $K.$ Namely, it consists of those elements of $K$ that are solutions of some polynomial equation of the form \[x^n + a_{n-1} x^{n-1} + \ldots+ a_0 =0\] with $a_0, \ldots, a_{n-1} \in \mathbb Z.$
