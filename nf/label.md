Each number field has a unique label of the form d.r.D.i where
<ul>
<li>\(d\) is the <a knowl="lmfdb/nf.degree">degree</a>;
<li>\(r\) is the real signature;  the full <a knowl="lmfdb/nf.signature">signature</a>; is therefore \([r,(d-r)/2]\);
<li>\(D\) is the absolute value of the <a knowl="lmfdb/nf.discriminant">discriminant</a>;
<li>\(i\) is the index, counting from 1.  This is case there is more than one
  field with the same signature and absolute value of the
  discriminant: for example 4.0.1008.1 and 4.0.1008.2.
</ul>
