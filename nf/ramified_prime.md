A **ramified prime** of a <a knowl="lmfdb/nf">number field </a> $K$ is a prime integer $p$ such that the ideal generated by $p$, when factored as a product of prime ideals in the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$ of $K$,
$$p\mathcal{O}_K = \mathcal{P}_1^{e_1}\cdots \mathcal{P}_k^{e_k}$$
has some repeated prime factor, i.e., some $e_i>1$.

The ramified primes of $K$ are exactly the primes which divide the <a knowl="lmfdb/nf.discriminant">discriminant</a> of $K$.
