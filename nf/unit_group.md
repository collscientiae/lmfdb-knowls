The **unit group** of a <a knowl="lmfdb/nf">number field</a> $K$ is the group of units of the ring of integers of $K$.  This is a finitely generated abelian group with cyclic torsion subgroup.  A set of generators of a maximal torsion-free subgroup is called a set of <a knowl="lmfdb/nf.fundamental_units">fundamental units</a> for $K$.    

The unit group of $K$ has as invariants:

- the <a knowl="lmfdb/nf.rank">rank</a>

- the <a knowl="lmfdb/nf.regulator">regulator</a> of $K$
