If $K/F$ is a finite degree field extension, $\alpha\in K$ is **separable** over $F$ if its monic irreducible polynomial has distinct roots in the algebraic closure $\overline{F}$.

The extension $K/F$ is **separable** if every $\alpha\in K$ is separable over $F$.

All local and global number fields are separable.
