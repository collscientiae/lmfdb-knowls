The LMFDB supports **nicknames**, short human-readable names for
various fields.  Examples include:

- Q, for the rationals $\mathbb Q$
- Qi, for $\mathbb Q(i)$
- QsqrtN, for $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{N})$.  Write Qsqrt-5 for $\mathbb Q(\sqrt{-5})$
- QzetaN, for $\mathbb Q(\zeta_N)$, where $\zeta_N$ is a primitive $N$th roof of unity.
