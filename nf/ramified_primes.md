A **ramified prime** of a number field $K$ is a prime integer $p$ such that when the ideal generated by $p$ is factored into prime ideals in the ring of integers $\mathcal{O}_K$ of $K$, 
$$p\mathcal{O}_K= \mathcal{P_1}^{e_1}\cdots \mathcal{P_k}^{e_k},$$  
there is an $i$ such that $e_i\geq 2$.

The ramified primes of $K$ are the primes dividing the <a knowl="lmfdb/nf.discriminant">discriminant</a> of $K$.
