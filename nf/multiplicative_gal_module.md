If $K$ is a number field with Galois closure $K^{gal}$, let $U$ be the group of units of the ring of integers of $K^{gal}$.  Let $M=U/\textrm{Tors}(U)$, the units modulo its torsion subgroup.  This is a lattice which is a module for $\Z[G]$ where $G=\textrm{Gal}(K^{gal}/\Q)$.  We give a decomposition of $M$ as a direct sum of indecomposable submodules.
