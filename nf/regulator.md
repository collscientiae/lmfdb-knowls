Let $\sigma_1,\ldots,\sigma_n$ be the embeddings of a <a knowl="lmfdb/nf">number field</a> $K$ into the complex numbers $\mathbb{C}$, and let $u_1,\ldots,u_r$ be the <a knowl="lmfdb/nf.fundamental_units">fundamental units</a> of $K$.    

The **regulator** of $K$ is a positive real number defined as the absolute value of the determinant of the matrix $(d_i\log{ \sigma_j(u_i)})$, where any one column is removed and $d_i$ is the degree of the embedding $\sigma_i$.
