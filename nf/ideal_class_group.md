The **ideal class group** of a <a knowl="lmfdb/nf">number field</a> $K$ is the group of equivalence classes of ideals, given by the quotient of the multiplicative group of all fractional ideals of $K$ by the subgroup of principal ideals.  

Since $K$ is a <a knowl="lmfdb/nf">number field</a>, the ideal class group of $K$ is a finite abelian group, and so has the structure of a product of cyclic groups encoded by a finite list $[a_1,\dots,a_n]$, where the $a_i$ are positive integers with $a_{i+1}\mid a_i$ for $1\le i<n$.
