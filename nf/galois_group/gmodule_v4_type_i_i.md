The notation follows Mazur and Ullom, Galois module structure of units in real biquadratic number fields, Acta Arithmetica 111.2 (2004). There are four basic types, I-IV, which describe the structure of the units $U$ modulo roots of unity. The subtype describes the actual structure of the units. Type I (i) means that there is a generating set for $U/\{\pm 1\}$ consisting of fundamental units of the quadratic subfields.
