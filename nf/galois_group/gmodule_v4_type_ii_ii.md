The notation follows Mazur and Ullom, Galois module structure of units in real biquadratic number fields, Acta Arithmetica 111.2 (2004). There are four basic types, I-IV, which describe the structure of the units $U$ modulo roots of unity. The subtype describes the actual structure of the units. Type II (ii) means that there are fundamental units $e_1,e_2,e_3$ of the three quadratic subfields such that $\sqrt{e_1e_2},e_2,\sqrt{e_3}$ generate the rank 3 group $U/\{\pm 1\}$.
