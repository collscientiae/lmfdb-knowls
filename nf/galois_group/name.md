Each Galois group is identified by its <a knowl="lmfdb/gg.degree">degree</a> and an index called its <a knowl="lmfdb/gg.tnumber">T-number</a>.  One may specify a group in the form $n$T$t$ where $n$ is the degree and $t$ is the T-number.

For familiar groups one can use short names from the table below.
An abstract group may have more than one
representation as a Galois group.  Correspondingly, the familiar
symbol for a group may represent several
Galois groups.  These combinations are shown below for $n\leq 11$.
