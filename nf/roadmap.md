Global number fields
====================
Currently have fields with small absolute discriminant in degrees $\leq 11$, and other complete sets of fields with degrees up to $15$.  See [completeness of global number field data for more details](/NumberField/Discriminants)

Home pages
----------
- Include links for subfields
- Include information on local algebras for ramified primes

Available Data
--------------
- Add fields with bigger degrees and discriminants, and with more diverse Galois groups.
