The **degree** of an <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction">L-function</a> is the number $J + 2K$ of <a knowl="lmfdb/specialfunction.gammarandc">Gamma factors</a> occurring in its <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.functional_equation">functional equation</a>

\[
\Lambda(s) := N^{s/2}
\prod_{j=1}^J \Gamma_{\mathbb R}(s+\mu_j) \prod_{k=1}^K \Gamma_{\mathbb C}(s+\nu_k)
\cdot L(s) = \varepsilon \overline{\Lambda}(1-s).
\]

The degree appears as the first component of the <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.selbergdata">Selberg data</a> of $L(s).$ In all known cases it is the degree of the polynomial of the inverse of the Euler factor at any prime not dividing the <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.level">level</a>.
