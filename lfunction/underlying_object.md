L-functions arise from many different sources. Already in degree 2 we have examples of
L-functions associated with <a knowl="lmfdb/mf.elliptic">holomorphic cusp forms</a>, with <a knowl="lmfdb/mf.maass.mwf">Maass forms,</a> with <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q">elliptic curves,</a> with characters of <a knowl="lmfdb/nf">number fields</a> (Hecke characters), and with 2-dimensional representations of the <a knowl="lmfdb/nf.galois_group">Galois group of a number field</a> (Artin L-functions). 

Sometimes an L-function may arise from more than one source. For example, the L-functions associated with elliptic curves are also associated with weight 2 cuspforms. A goal of the Langlands program ostensibly is to prove that any degree $d$ L-function is associated with an automorphic form on $\mathrm{GL}(d)$. Because of this representation theoretic genesis, one can associate an L-function not only to an automorphic representation but also to symmetric powers, or exterior powers of that representation, or to the tensor product of two representations (the Rankin-Selberg product of two L-functions).
