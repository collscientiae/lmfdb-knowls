The **sign** of the functional equation of an analytic L-function, also called the **root number**, is the number $\varepsilon$ in the <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.functional_equation">functional equation</a> of $\Lambda(s)=\varepsilon \overline{\Lambda}(1-s)$.  The sign appears as the 4th entry in the quadruple
known as the <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.selbergdata">Selberg data.</a>
