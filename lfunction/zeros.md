It is expected that the <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.rh">Riemann Hypothesis</a> holds for all analytic <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction">L-functions</a>. The **lowest zero** is the smallest number $\gamma>0$ such that $L(1/2+i\gamma)=0$. Some L-functions have $L(1/2)=0$, but note that for the purposes of this search, the **lowest zero** is a positive real number.
