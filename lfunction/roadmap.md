L-functions
===========

Navigation pages
----------------

- Reorganize the degree 3 and 4 navigation pages to allow browsing in terms of functional equation parameters in addition to browsing by underlying object.
- Add searching by first zero, coefficients, functional equation parameters, and underlying object.
- Show the sign of the Dirichlet L-functions as a color code on the browsing graph.
       
Home pages
----------

- Smoothly handle the zeros and Z-function plot in the cases where not enough coefficients are available.
- Allow the user to choose arithmetic or analytic normalization (for arithmetic L-functions).
- Display more coefficients for L-functions with vary sparse Dirichlet series, and condense the display for floating point coefficients.
- Add section for Special Values
- Recognize non-primitive L-functions and provide links to the primitive components. (sym^2 of CM curves, Dedekind zeta-function in the nonabelian case, etc)
- Links to more friends: dual L-function (if not self-dual), twists, symmetric powers, other powers.
- Next/previous navigation for more L-functions (e.g. GL(2) Maass forms).
- Button to test the Riemann hypothesis in a given range (or automatically check it)

Available data
--------------

Add the L-functions of:  Maass forms (some currently limited by the number of
       available coefficients),  $sym^2$ of CM elliptic curves, $sym^2$ of other GL(2) objects,
       Siegel modular forms, Hilbert modular forms (Asai L-function), Artin representations.
