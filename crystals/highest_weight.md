Highest weight crystals are <a knowl="lmfdb/crystals.crystal">crystals.crystal</a> which have a highest weight element. A highest weight element $b$ is annihilated by all Kashiwara raising operators:
\[
e_i b = 0 \quad \text{for all } i\in I.
\]
The weight of the highest weight element is used to label the crystal.
