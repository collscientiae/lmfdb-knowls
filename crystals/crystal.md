A $U_q(\mathfrak{g})$ crystal is a nonempty set $B$ together with maps
\[
\begin{equation*}
\begin{split}
   &\mathrm{wt}: B \to P\\
   &e_i, f_i : B \to B \cup \{0\} \quad \text{for all } i\in I.
\end{split}
\end{equation*} 
\]
Here $\mathfrak{g}$ is a Lie or Kac-Moody algebra of a particular type with index set $I$.

The map $\mathrm{wt}$ is called the weight function which maps a crystal element to a weight in the weight lattice $P$. The maps $e_i$ and $f_i$ are called Kashiwara raising and lowering operators.
