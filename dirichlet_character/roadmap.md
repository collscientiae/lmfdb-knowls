Dirichlet characters
====================

## Home pages

- improve speed
- add magma commands (and pari when characters are released)
- show a graph of characters above and below (parents and sons)
- show minimal polynomial and galois orbit

## Search

- group characters by Galois orbits
- search from values

## Available data

-  add Dirichlet characters over number fields
-  add Hecke characters on ideals and link with Hecke L-functions
