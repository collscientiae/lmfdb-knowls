Each family in the Hypergeometric/Q part of LMFDB is a motive over the field $\Q(t)$ with coefficients in $\Q$ of some degree $d \in \Z_{\geq 1}$.  They are indexed by non-overlapping ordered pairs of multisets of positive integers $(A,B)$ with $\sum_{a \in A} \phi(a) = \sum_{b \in B} \phi(b) = d$.
