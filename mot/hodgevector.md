Let $H(\alpha,\beta)$ be a hypergeometric family of degree $d$ and weight $w$. The Hodge vector of $H(\alpha,\beta)$ depends on how the indices $\alpha_j$ and  $\beta_k$ and intertwine on the circle $\R/\Z$.   At the extreme of complete intertwining, the Hodge vector is $(h^{0,0}) = (d)$.  At the extreme of complete separation, $d = w+1$ and
the Hodge vector is $(h^{0,w},\dots,h^{w,0}) = (1,\dots,1)$.  

For $t \in \Q^\times - \{1\}$ the motive $H(\alpha,\beta,t)$ has the same Hodge vector.  For $t=1$ the motive $H(\alpha,\beta,t)$ has degree $d-1$ or $d-2$, according to whether
$w$ is even or odd.  If $w$ is even, the middle Hodge number $h^{w/2,w/2}$ drops by $1$. If $w$ is odd, the two middle Hodge numbers drops by $1$.
