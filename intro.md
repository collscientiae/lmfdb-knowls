Welcome to the LMFDB, the database of L-functions, modular forms, and
related objects.  These pages are intended to be a modern handbook
including tables, formulas, links, references, etc. to very concrete
objects, in particular specific L-functions and their sources.

L-functions are ubiquitous in number theory and have applications to
mathematical physics and cryptography.  By an L-function, we generally mean a
Dirichlet series with a functional equation and an Euler product, the simplest example being the Riemann zeta function.  Two of the seven Clay
Mathematics Million Dollar Millennium Problems deal with properties of
these functions, namely the Riemann Hypothesis and the Birch and
Swinnerton-Dyer Conjecture.

L-functions arise from and encode information about a number of
mathematical objects. It is necessary to exhibit these
objects along with the L-functions themselves, since typically we need
these objects to compute L-functions.  In these pages you will see
examples of L-functions coming from modular forms, elliptic curves,
number fields, and Dirichlet characters, as well as more generally
from automorphic forms, algebraic varieties, and Artin
representations.  In addition, the database contains details about
these objects themselves.  See the <a href='<b>bigpicture</b>'>Map of LMFDB</a>
for descriptions of
 connections between these objects.  For additional information, there
is a useful collection of freely available online sources at
<a href='http://www.numbertheory.org/ntw/lecture_notes.html'>http://www.numbertheory.org/ntw/lecture_notes.html</a>.

The subject of L-functions is very rich, with many interrelationships. 
Our goal is to describe the data in ways that faithfully
exhibit these interconnections, and to offer access to the data
as a means of prompting further exploration and discovery.

We believe that the creation of this website will lead to the
development and understanding of new mathematics.
