Given an elliptic curve $E$ over a field $K,$ the **torsion subgroup** of $E$ over $K$ is the subgroup of the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.mordell_weil">Mordell-Weil group</a> $E(K)$ consisting of points of finite order.  For a number field $K$ this is always a finite group, and is either cyclic or a product of two cyclic groups.

The "torsion structure" is the list of invariants of the group:

- $[]$ for the trivial group;
- $[n]$ for a cyclic group of order $n$;
- $[n_1,n_2]$ with $n_1\mid n_2$ for a product of cyclic groups of orders $n_1$ and $n_2$.
