A **Weierstrass equation** for an elliptic curve $E$ defined over a field $K$ is a model for $E$ of the form
$$y^2 + a_1xy + a_3y = x^3 + a_2 x^2 + a_4 x + a_6,$$
with $a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_6 \in K$.  The **Weierstrass coefficients** of $E$ (strictly, of this model for $E$) are the five coefficients $a_i$.  These are often displayed as a list
$[a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_6]$.
