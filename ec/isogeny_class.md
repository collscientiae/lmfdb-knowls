The **isogeny class (over a field $K$)** of an <a knowl="lmfdb/ec">elliptic curve</a> $E$ defined over $K$ is the set of all isomorphism classes of elliptic curves defined over $K$ that are <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.isogeny">isogenous</a> to $E$ over $K$.  Over a number field $K$ this is always a finite set.
