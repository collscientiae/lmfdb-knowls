An **elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$** has a Weierstrass equation of the form
$$E : y^2 = x^3 + ax + b$$ with $a, b \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that its <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.discriminant">discriminant</a>
$$\Delta := âˆ’16(4a^3 + 27b^2 ) \not= 0.$$
Note that such an equation is not unique, but $E$ has a unique <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.minimal_weierstrass_equation">minimal Weierstrass equation</a>.
