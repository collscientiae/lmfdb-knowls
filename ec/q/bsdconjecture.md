The **Birch and Swinnerton-Dyer** conjecture is one of the Millennium Prize Problems listed by the Clay Mathematics Institute. It relates the order of vanishing and the first non-zero Taylor series coefficient of  the L-function associated to an elliptic curve $E$ at the central point $s=1$ to certain arithmetic data (the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.bsd_invariants">BSD invariants</a> of $E$). Namely it states that the order of vanishing $r$ of $L(E,s)$ at $s=1$ is equal to the rank of the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.mordell-weil">Mordell-Weil group</a> and that

<p align="center"> $\displaystyle \frac{1}{r!} L^{(r)}(E,1)=  \displaystyle \frac{\# &#1064;(E)\cdot \Omega \cdot \mathrm{Reg} \cdot \prod_p c_p}{(\#E_{tor})^2}. $ </p>
