Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over $\Q$.  A prime $p$ is called a **surjective prime** for $E$ if the mod-$p$ <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.galois_rep">Galois representation</a> 
\[
\rho_{E,p}: Gal(\overline{\Q}/\Q) \to \GL(2,\F_p)
\]
attached to $E$ is surjective.

Conjecturally, when $E$ does not have <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.complex_multiplication">CM</a>, all primes $p>37$ are surjective primes.
