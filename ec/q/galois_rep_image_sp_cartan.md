This is one of the six possible cases for the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.galois_rep_image">image of the mod $p$ Galois Representation</a> if $p$ is a<a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.non-surjective_prime">non-surjective prime</a> for $E$.  

The label **Cs** means that the group $G$ is contained in the full split Cartan subgroup of $\GL(2,\F_p)$, i.e., up to conjugation, the unique maximal abelian subgroups of $\GL(2,\F_p)$  isomorphic to $\F_p^*\times\F_p^*$.
 
The label **Cs.a.b** means that the group $G$ is contained in the subgroup of the full split Cartan subgroup generated by
\[
\begin{pmatrix}a&0\\0&1/a\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}b&0\\0&r/b\end{pmatrix}.
\]
where $r$ be the least positive integer that generates $\F_p^*$.
