This is one of the six possible cases for the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.galois_rep_image">image of the mod $p$ Galois Representation</a> if $p$ is a <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.non-surjective_prime">non-surjective prime</a> for $E$.  

The label **Cn** means that $G$ is contained in the nonsplit Cartan subgroup which is, up to conjugation, the unique maximal abelian subgroups of $\GL(2,\F_p)$ isomorphic to 
$\F_{p^2}^*$. 

For $p=2$ is the unique index 2 subgroup of $\GL(2,\F_2)$ and for $p$ odd consists of all matrices
\[
\begin{pmatrix}x&ry\\y&x\end{pmatrix}, 
\]
where $r$ be the least positive integer that generates $\F_p^*$.
