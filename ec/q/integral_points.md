The **integral points** of an elliptic curve $E$ defined over $\mathbb Q$ are the points on a minimal model of $E$ that have integer coordinates. 

To find them, pick a minimal Weierstrass equation for $E.$  The integral points are those solutions $(x,y)$ of the minimal Weierstrass equation that have integer coordinates. The number of integral points is finite (by a theorem of Siegel).
