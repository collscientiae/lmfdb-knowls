The **LMFDB label** of an elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb{Q}$ is  a way of indexing the elliptic curves over $\mathbb Q.$ It has the form $11.a1$ or $10050.bf2.$ The first number represents the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.conductor">conductor</a>. The letter or letters represent the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.isogeny_class">isogeny class</a> sorted lexicographically by the $q$-expansion of the associated modular form, read in base $26$ with leading $a'$s deleted. The last number represents the lexicographic order of the coefficients $[a_1, a_2, a_3, a_4, a_6]$ of the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.minimal_weierstrass_equation">minimal Weierstrass equation</a> of $E$. 


Note that this is not the same as the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.cremona_label">Cremona label</a>, even though it might coincide for certain curves. The punctuation indicates that a label follows the new indexing paradigm.
