The **Cremona label** of an elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ is  a way of indexing the elliptic curves over $\mathbb Q.$ The first number represents the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.conductor">conductor</a>, the letter or letters represent the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.isogeny_class">isogeny class</a> and the last number represents the isomorphism class within the isogeny class as it appears in [Cremona's tables.](http://www.warwick.ac.uk/staff/J.E.Cremona/ftp/data/INDEX.html)<br> 
For more details, see "The elliptic curve database for conductors to 130000" by John Cremona in ANTS-VII proceedings, Lecture Notes in Computer Science, vol. 4076, 2006, 11-29. 

In the Cremona labeling, it is somewhat difficult to describe the mechanisms for ordering isogeny classes or curves within a class. For this reason, within this site we use the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.lmfdb_label">LMFDB label</a>, whose definition is somewhat simpler. Note that the lack of internal punctuation distinguishes Cremona labels from LMFDB labels.
