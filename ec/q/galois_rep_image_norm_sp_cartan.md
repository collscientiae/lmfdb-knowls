This is one of the six possible cases for the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.galois_rep_image">image of the mod $p$ Galois Representation</a> if $p$ is a <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.non-surjective_prime">non-surjective prime</a> for $E$.  

The label **Ns** means that $G$ is contained in the normalizer of the split Cartan subgroup but not in the split Cartan subgroup itself.
 
 
The label **Ns.a.b** means that $G$ is contained in the subgroup of the normalizer of the split Cartan subgroug  generated by
\[
\begin{pmatrix}a&0\\0&1/a\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}0&b\\-r/b&0\end{pmatrix},
\]
where $r$ be the least positive integer that generates $\F_p^*$.
 
 
The label **Ns.a.b.c**  means that $G$ is contained in the subgroup of the normalizer of the split Cartan subgroup generated by
\[
\begin{pmatrix}a&0\\0&1/a\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}0&b\\-1/b&0\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}0&c\\-r/c&0\end{pmatrix}
\]
where $r$ be the least positive integer that generates $\F_p^*$. Conjecturally, this case arises only when $E$ has CM.
