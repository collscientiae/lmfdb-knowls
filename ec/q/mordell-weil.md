Given an elliptic curve $E$ over a field $K,$ the **Mordell-Weil group** of $E$ is the group of $K$-rational points of $E.$ It is denoted $E(K).$

A theorem of Mordell (later generalized by Weil to abelian varieties) states that, if $K$ is a number field, then $E(K)$ is a finitely generated abelian group. Its rank is called the **Mordell-Weil rank** of $E.$ Mordell's theorem also implies that the torsion subgroup of $E(K)$ is finite, and thus the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.torsion_order">torsion order</a> of $E$, one of the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.bsd_invariants">BSD invariants</a>, is finite.
