To find the **reduction type** of an elliptic curve $E$ over $\mathbb Q$ at a prime $p$ start with the minimal Weierstrass equation of $E$ and take its reduction $\tilde E$  modulo $p.$ 

$E$ has **good reduction** at $p$ if $\tilde E$ is non-singular over $\mathbb F_p.$
$E$ has **multiplicative reduction** at $p$ if $\tilde E$ has a nodal singularity. It is called **split** if the two branches at the node are defined over $\mathbb F_p$ and **non-split** otherwise. The Fourier coefficient $a(p)$ of $L(E,s)$ is $1$ if the reduction is split and $-1$ if it is non-split.  
$E$ has **additive reduction** at $p$ if $\tilde E$ has a cuspidal singularity. In this case $a(p)=0.$
