The **elliptic regulator** of an elliptic curve $E$ over a number field $K,$ denoted $\mbox{Reg}(E/K)$, is the volume of $E(K)/E(K)_{tor}$ computed using the pairing associated to the canonical height $\hat h$ of $E$ on $\mathbb R \otimes E(K).$ In other words, if we choose $P_1, \ldots, P_r$ to generate the free part $E(K)/E(K)_{tor}$ of the Mordell-Weil group, then \[ \mbox{Reg}(E/K) = \det (\langle P_i, P_j \rangle )_{1\leq i,j \leq r}.\]

If the rank of $r=0$, we take $\mbox{Reg}(E/K)=1$ by convention.
