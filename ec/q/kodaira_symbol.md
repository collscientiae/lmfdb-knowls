The **Kodaira symbol** encodes the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.reduction_type">reduction type</a> of an elliptic curve at a prime $p.$ It describes the combinatorics of the special fiber of the N&eacute;ron model of the elliptic curve. The N&eacute;ron model is obtained from the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.minimal_weierstrass_equation">minimal Weierstrass equation</a> using Tate's algorithm. For an exact definition and properties, consult a text on elliptic curves.
