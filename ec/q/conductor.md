The **conductor** $N$ of an <a knowl="lmfdb/ec">elliptic curve</a> $E$ defined over $\Q$ is a positive integer divisible by the primes of bad reduction and no others.  The exponent $e_p$ of a prime $p$ in $N$ is 

- $e_p=1$ if $E$ has multiplicative reduction at $p$, 

- $e_p=2$ if $E$ has additive reduction at $p$ and $p\ge5$, and 

- $2\leq e_p\leq 5$ if $E$ has additive reduction and $p=2$ or $p=3$. 

For the precise recipe for the exponent when $p=2,3$ see a text on elliptic curves.
