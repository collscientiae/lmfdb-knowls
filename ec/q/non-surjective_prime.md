Let $E$ be an elliptic curve defined over $\Q$.  A prime $p$ is called a **non-surjective** prime for $E$ if the mod-$p$ <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.galois_rep">Galois representation</a> 
\[
\rho_{E,p}: Gal(\overline{\Q}/\Q) \to \GL(2,\F_p)
\]
attached to $E$ is **not** surjective.   

There are only finitely many non-surjective primes for any elliptic curve without <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.complex_multiplication">CM</a>.  This is a result of Serre.  Conjecturally, the largest possible non-surjective prime is $37$.
