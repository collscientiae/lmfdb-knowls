Any elliptic curve over $\mathbb{Q}$ has a Weierstrass model (or equation) of the form \[y^2+a_1xy+a_3y=x^3+a_2x^2+a_4x+a_6.\]
Each such equation has a <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.discriminant">discriminant</a> $\Delta$.  A **minimal Weierstrass equation** is one for which $|\Delta|$ is minimal among all Weierstrass models for the same curve.  For elliptic curves over $\mathbb{Q}$, minimal models exist, and there is a unique minimal model which satisfies the additional constraints $a_1,a_3\in\{0,1\}$, $a_2\in\{-1,0,1\}$.
