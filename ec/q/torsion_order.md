If $E$ is an elliptic curve defined over $\mathbb{Q}$, the **torsion subgroup** of $E$ is the subgroup of the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.mordell-weil">Mordell-Weil group</a> $E(\mathbb{Q})$ consisting of all the rational points of finite order.  It is a finite abelian group (by a theorem of Mordell) of order at most $16$ (by a theorem of Mazur).  This order is the **torsion order** of $E$.
