This is one of the six possible cases for the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.galois_rep_image">image of the mod $p$ Galois Representation</a> if $p$ is a <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.non-surjective_prime">non-surjective prime</a> for $E$.  

Any label starting with **B** means that the group $G$ is contained in the Borel subgroup in $\GL(2,\F_p)$, i.e. a conjugate of the upper triangular group in $\GL(2,\F_p)$, and not contained in the subgroup of diagonal matrices. 

The label **B** means that the group $G$ is the full Borel subgroup in $\GL(2,\F_p)$.
		 
The label **B.a.b** means that the group $G$ is contained in the subgroup of the upper triangular group generated by the matrices
\[
\begin{pmatrix}a&0\\0&1/a\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}b&0\\0&r/b\end{pmatrix}, \begin{pmatrix}1&1\\0&1\end{pmatrix}.
\]		
where $r$ be the least positive integer that generates $\F_p^*$.
