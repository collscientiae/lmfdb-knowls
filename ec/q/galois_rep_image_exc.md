This is one of the six possible cases for the <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.galois_rep_image">image of the mod $p$ Galois Representation</a> if $p$ is a <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.non-surjective_prime">non-surjective prime</a> for $E$.  

The label **S4** means that $G$ is the full pre-image in $\GL(2,\F_p)$ of a subgroup (unique up to conjugacy) of $\PGL(2,\F_p)$ that is isomorphic to the symmetric group on 
$4$ elements. This case can occur only if $p$ is congruent to $1$ modulo $4$.
