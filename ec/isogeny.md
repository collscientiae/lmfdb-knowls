Let $E_1$ and $E_2$ be two <a knowl="lmfdb/ec">elliptic curves</a> defined over the field $K$. An **isogeny over $K$** between $E_1$ and $E_2$ is a morphism $f:E_1 \to E_2$ defined over $K$ such that $f(O_{E_1})= O_{E_2}$. The two curves are called **isogenous** if there exists a nonzero isogeny $f:E_1 \to E_2$.

Isogeny is an equivalence relation, and the equivalence classes are called <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.isogeny_class">isogeny classes</a>.
