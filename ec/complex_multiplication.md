An elliptic curve whose <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.endomorphism_ring">ec.q.endomorphism_ring</a> is larger than \(\Z\) is said to have Complex Multiplication.  In this case, for curves defined over fields of characteristic zero, the endomorphism ring is isomorphic to an order in an imaginary quadratic field.
