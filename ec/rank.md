The **rank** of an elliptic curve $E$ over a number field $K$ is the rank of its <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.q.mordell-weil">Mordell-Weil group</a>  $E(K)$. We know by a theorem of Mordell (later generalized by Weil to abelian varieties) that $E(K)$ is a finitely-generated abelian group, and thus the rank is finite.
