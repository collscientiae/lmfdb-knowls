A Knowl is context-free information.  Knowls can be embedded into a web page or
assembled into a document which conveys information in a non-linear fashion.

Knowls were created by <a knowl="lmfdb/bio.harald_schilly">Harald Schilly</a>, with the first working version coming
online on August 25, 2011. Schilly also coined the term "knowl".  This work was
supported by <a knowl="lmfdb/demo.knowl.grants">two grants</a> 
to <a knowl="lmfdb/demo.aim">AIM</a>
from the
<a href='Division of Mathematical Sciences'>http://www.nsf.gov/div/index.jsp?div=DMS</a>
of the <a href='National Science Foundation'>http://www.nsf.gov/</a>.


"Knowl" is pronounced _nohl_, as in "A knoll is a small hill."
