title: Table of first zeros of L-function

These tables contain the first positive zero of each Dirichlet L-function with level under 5000 and each elliptic curve L-function with conductor less than 200000.

This data was computed using lcalc 1.23, and no specific claim is made about accuracy. Most of the printed digits should be correct, but the last few might be wrong in some cases.
