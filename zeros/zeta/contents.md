These tables currently contain the first 103,800,788,359 zeros of $\zeta(s)$, covering the range $0 < t < 30610046000$, computed by David Platt to an absolute precision of $2^{-101}$.

Currently, they are not perfectly printed, and the last few digits may not always be printed correctly in base 10.
