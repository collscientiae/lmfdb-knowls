title: Automorphism group of a field extension

If $K/F$ is an extension of fields, its automorphism group is
$$ \textrm{Aut}(K/F) = \{\sigma:K\to K\mid  \forall a\in F, \sigma(a)=a, \text{ and } \sigma \text{ is an isomorphism}\}.$$
Note, a finite extension is Galois if and only if $|\textrm{Aut}(K/F)| = [K:F]$.
