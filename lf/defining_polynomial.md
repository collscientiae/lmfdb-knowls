The **defining polynomial** of a <a knowl="lmfdb/lf">local field</a> $K$ is an irreducible polynomial $f(x)\in\mathbb{Q}_p[x]$ such that $K\cong \mathbb{Q}_p(a)$, where $a$ is a root of $f(x)$.

The defining polynomial can be chosen to be monic with coefficients in $\mathbb{Z}_p$; by Krasner's lemma, we can further take $f(x)\in \mathbb{Z}[x]$.
