title: The unramified/totally ramified tower of a local field

If $K$ is a finite extension of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for some prime $p$, then there is a unique intermediate field $F$ such that $F/\mathbb{Q}_p$ is unramified and $K/F$ is totally ramified.

For the maximal unramified subfield, we give its defining polynomial in $t$, and the totally ramified extension can then be given by an Eisenstein polynomial over $\mathbb{Q}_p[t]$.
