Each local field is given a unique label of the form "p.n.c.num".  Here p is the prime for the base $\mathbb{Q}_p$, n is the degree of the extension over $\mathbb{Q}_p$, c is the discriminant exponent, and num is a positive integer which simply counts which field this is among those with the same triple (p,n,c).
