Local number fields
===================
Currently have all degree $n$ fields over $\mathbb{Q}_p$ for $p<150$ and $1\leq n\leq11$.

Navigation
----------
- Allow searching by inputing a prime and a polynomial (return components of the local algebra)
- Allow download of fields coming from a search

Home pages
----------
Give components of interesting local resolvent algebras, such as twins for sextics and $D_4$ quartics

Available data
--------------
- Hope to add higher degree fields once data has been computed for wildly ramified fields of degree 12
