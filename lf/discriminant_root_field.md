If $K/F$ is a finite algebraic extension, it can be defined by a polynomial $f(x)\in F[x]$.  The polynomial discriminant, $\mathrm{disc}(f)$, is well-defined up a factor of a non-zero square.  The ** discriminant root field ** of the extension is $F(\sqrt{\mathrm{disc}(f)})$, which is well-defined.

If $n=[K:F]$, then the Galois group $G$ for $K/F$ is a subgroup of $S_n$, well-defined up to conjugation.  The discriminant root field can alternatively be described as the fixed field of $G\cap A_n$.

Note if $F=\mathbb{Q}_p$, there are only a small number of possibilities for quadratic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_p$.  If $p$ is odd, we let $*$ denote a unit in $\mathbb{Z}_p$ which is not a square modulo $p$.  Then, the quadratic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_p$ are $\mathbb{Q}_p(\sqrt{*})$ (which is the unramified quadratic extension), $\mathbb{Q}_p(\sqrt{p})$, and $\mathbb{Q}_p(\sqrt{p*})$.

For $p=2$, there are seven quadratic extensions of $\mathbb{Q}_2$.  Here we let $*$ denote a value in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ which is congruent to $5$ modulo $8$ so again $\mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{*})$ is the quadratic unramified extension; the other six quadratic extensions are $\mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{-1})$, $\mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{-*})$, $\mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{2})$, $\mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{2*})$, $\mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{-2})$, and $\mathbb{Q}_2(\sqrt{-2*})$.
