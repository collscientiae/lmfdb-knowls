title: Definition of $\Q_p$

If $p$ is a prime number, then every rational number $r$ can be written in the form $r=p^j \frac{a}{b}$ where $\gcd(p, ab)=1$.  We define $|r|_p = p^{-j}$, and define a metric on $\Q$ by $d(u,v) = |u-v|_p$.  The completion of $\Q$ with respect to this metric is $\Q_p$, which is itself a field in the natural way.
