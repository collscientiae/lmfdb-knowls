**Atle Selberg** (1917-2007) is a Norwegian mathematican who won the Fields Medal in 1950 and provided an elementary proof of *The Prime Number Theorem*, that ${\displaystyle \lim_{x \rightarrow \infty} \frac{ \pi(x)}{x / \ln(x)} = 1}$, where $\pi(x)$ is the number of primes less than or equal to $x$.
