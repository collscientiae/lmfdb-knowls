**Johann Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet** (1805-1859) was a German mathematician who investigated the idea of <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.dirichlet_series">Dirichlet series</a> and proved *Dirichlet's Theorem on Primes in Arithmetic Progressions*, that for relatively prime positive integers $a$ and $k$, there are infinitely many primes of the form $a + kn$, where $n \in {\mathbb N}$.
