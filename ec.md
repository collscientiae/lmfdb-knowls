An **elliptic curve** over a field $K$ is a <a knowl="lmfdb/ag.curve.smooth">smooth</a> <a knowl="lmfdb/ag.curve">projective curve</a> $E$ defined over $K$ of <a knowl="lmfdb/ag.curve.genus">genus</a> $1$ together with a (distinguished) $K$-rational point $O$ of $E.$


The most commonly used model for elliptic curves is a plane cubic defined by a <a knowl="lmfdb/ec.weierstrass_coeffs">Weierstrass Equation</a>, with the distinguished point $O$ being the unique point at infinity.
