The term **modular form** is used to describe several types
of complex functions which have a certain type of <a knowl="lmfdb/mf.transformation_property">functional equation</a> and <a knowl="lmfdb/mf.growth_condition">growth condition</a>.  Examples include:

- <a knowl="lmfdb/mf.elliptic">Elliptic Modular Forms</a>
- <a knowl="lmfdb/mf.maass">Maass Waveforms</a>
- <a knowl="lmfdb/mf.hilbert">Hilbert Modular Forms</a>
- <a knowl="lmfdb/mf.siegel">Siegel Modular Forms</a>
