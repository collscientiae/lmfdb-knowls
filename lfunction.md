An  **analytic L -function** is a <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.dirichlet_series">Dirichlet series</a>
that has an <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.euler_product">Euler product</a> and satisfies a certain 
type of <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.functional_equation">functional equation</a>. 

In this database
analytic L-functions are normalized so that 
1/2 is the central point and the functional
equation relates the values at $s$ and $1-s$.
It is expected that all analytic L-functions satisfy the 
<a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.rh">Riemann Hypothesis,</a> that all of the zeros in the <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.critical_strip">critical 
strip</a> are on the <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.critical_line">critical 
line</a>. 

Selberg has defined a class $\mathcal S$ of Dirichlet series
via <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.selberg_class.axioms">4 axioms.</a> It is expected, but far from proven,
that $\mathcal S$ is precisely the collection of analytic L-functions.

Some of Selberg's axioms have not yet been verified 
for some of the L-functions in this database. Also,
it is conjectured that a very precise form of the 
<a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.functional_equation">functional equation</a> exists for every element of $\mathcal S$.
The assumption of this conjecture leads to a nice
compact way to express the functional equation data.
We call the 4-tuple that arises in this way the <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.selbergdata">Selberg data</a>,
and we base our entire catalog of L-functions on 
the natural hierarchy that arises from this quadruple, in particular 
<a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.degree">degree</a>, <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.level">level</a>, <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.spectral_parameters">spectral parameters</a>, and <a knowl="lmfdb/lfunction.root_number">sign</a>.
